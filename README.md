# Local Data Platform 

I like to organise data and I don't like paying cloud companies who train their models using user data, hence I came up with this repository which helps anyone learn data engineering best practices locally or maintain their data locally.

## Components 

1. Orchestrator 
   - cron
   - Airflow
2. Source
   - APIs
   - Files
3. Target
   - Iceberg
   - DuckDB
   - Space and Time
4. Catalog
   - Rest
